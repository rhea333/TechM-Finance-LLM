  - question: Explain the concept of buy and hold
    answer: >
      A buy-and-hold strategy is a classic that\'s proven itself over and over.
      With this strategy you do exactly what the name suggests: you buy an
      investment and then hold it indefinitely. Ideally, you\'ll never sell the
      investment, but you should look to own it for at least three to five
      years.

      Advantages:
      The buy-and-hold strategy focuses you on the long term and thinking like
      an owner, so you avoid the active trading that hurts the returns of most
      investors. Your success depends on how the underlying business performs
      over time. And this is how you can ultimately find the stock market\'s
      biggest winners and possibly earn hundreds of times your original
      investment.

      The beauty of this approach is that if you commit to never selling, then
      you don\'t ever have to think about it again. If you never sell, you\'ll
      avoid capital gains taxes, a return killer. A long-term buy-and-hold
      strategy means you\'re not always focused on the market - unlike traders -
      so you can spend time doing things you love instead of being chained to
      watching the market all day.

      Risks:
      To succeed with this strategy, you\'ll need to avoid the temptation to sell
      when the market gets rough. You\'ll have to endure the market\'s sometimes
      steep falls, and a 50 percent or greater drop is possible, with individual
      stocks potentially falling even more. That\'s easier said than done.
  - question: Explain income investing
    answer: >
      Income investing is owning investments that produce cash payouts, often
      dividend stocks and bonds. Part of your return comes in the form of hard
      cash, which you can use for anything you want, or you can reinvest the
      payouts into more stocks and bonds. If you own income stocks, you could
      also still enjoy the benefits of capital gains in addition to the cash
      income.
  - question: Explain buy index funds
    answer: >
      This strategy is all about finding an attractive stock index and then buying 
      an index fund based on it. Two popular indexes are the Standard & Poor\'s 500 
      and the Nasdaq Composite. Each has many of the market\'s top stocks, giving 
      you a well-diversified collection of investments, even if it\'s the only 
      investment you own. (This list of best index funds can get you started.) 
      Rather than trying to beat the market, you simply own the market through 
      the fund and get its returns.

      Advantages: 
      Buying an index fund is a simple approach that can yield great results,
      especially when you pair it with a buy-and-hold mentality. Your 
      return will be the weighted average of the index\'s assets. 
      And with a diversified portfolio, you\'ll have lower risk than 
      owning just a few stocks. Plus, you won\'t have to analyze individual 
      stocks to invest in, so it requires much less work, meaning you have time 
      to spend on other fun things while your money works for you.

      Risks: Investing in stocks can be risky, but owning a diversified portfolio 
      of stocks is considered a safer way to do it. But if you want to achieve the 
      market\'s long-term returns - an average of about 10 percent annually for the 
      S&P 500 - you\'ll need to hold on through the tough times and not sell. 
      Also, because you\'re buying a collection of stocks, you\'ll get their average 
      return, not the return of the hottest stocks. That said, most investors, 
      even the pros, struggle to beat the indexes over time.
  - question: Explain dollar-cost averaging topic
    answer: >
      Dollar-cost averaging is the practice of adding money to your investments at regular intervals. 
      For example, you may determine that you can invest $500 a month. So each month you put $500 to 
      work, regardless of what the market is doing. Or maybe you add $125 each week instead. By 
      regularly purchasing an investment, you\'re spreading out your buy points.
      
      Advantages: 
      By spreading out your buy points, you\'re avoiding the risk of “timing the market,” 
      meaning the risk of dumping all your money in at once. Dollar-cost averaging means you\'ll 
      get an average purchase price over time, ensuring that you\'re not buying too high. 
      Dollar-cost averaging is also good for helping to establish a regular investing discipline. 
      Over time you\'re likely to wind up with a larger portfolio, if only because you were disciplined in your approach.
      
      Risks: 
      While the consistent method of dollar-cost averaging helps you avoid going all-in at exactly the wrong 
      time, it also means you won\'t go all-in at exactly the right time. So you\'re unlikely to end up with 
      the highest possible returns on your investment.Investing is a wide world, and new investors have a lot 
      to learn to get up to speed. The good news is that beginners can make investing relatively simple with a 
      few basic steps while they leave all the complex stuff to the pros.Bankrate offers several resources for 
      new investors:The links above will get you started on your investing journey. You\'ll get educational

      so you can get started quickly, even today if you just want to look around.Investing can be one of the 
      best decisions you can make for yourself, but getting started can be tough. Simplify the process by 
      picking a popular investment strategy that can work for you and then stick with it. When you become
      more fully versed in investing, then you can expand your strategies and the types of investments
      you can make.

  - question: What is the definition of Economics?
    answer: >
      Economics is the study of how people allocate scarce resources for production, distribution, and consumption, both individually and 
      collectively. Economics plays a pivotal role in shaping your personal financial landscape. Here\'s how various economic factors can 
      directly impact your day-to-day financial decisions and long-term planning:
      
      Impact on Purchasing Power:
      When inflation rises, the cost of goods and services increases. This means that over time, the money you earn can buy less than it
      used to. For example, if you have a set budget for groceries or utilities, you might notice that you\'re getting fewer items or paying
      more for the same services.
      Personal Strategy: To mitigate the impact of inflation, consider investing in assets that historically outpace inflation, such as 
      stocks or real estate.

      Borrowing Costs:
      Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing money. This affects loans, credit cards, and mortgages. For instance, if you have
      a student loan or are planning to buy a home, higher interest rates mean you\'ll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.
      Personal Strategy: Shop around for the best interest rates, and consider refinancing high-interest debt when rates are low. Also, try
      to pay off high-interest debts faster to save on interest payments.

      Impact on Travel and Purchases:
      If you travel abroad or buy goods and services from other countries, exchange rate fluctuations can affect how much you pay.
      Personal Strategy: Monitor exchange rates and plan international travel or purchases when rates are favorable. Consider using credit
      cards that offer no foreign transaction fees to save money.
  - question: What is a 403(b) Plan?
    answer: >
      A 403(b) plan is a retirement savings plan available to employees of certain public schools, tax-exempt organizations, and ministers. It functions similarly to a 401(k) plan, allowing participants to save and invest a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Contributions and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically after retirement.

      Impact on Retirement Savings:
      Contributing to a 403(b) plan can significantly impact your retirement savings by providing tax advantages and potentially employer matching contributions. These contributions reduce your current taxable income, which can result in lower taxes today.
      Personal Strategy: Maximize contributions to your 403(b) plan, especially if your employer offers a match. Consider diversifying your investment options within the plan to balance growth and risk according to your retirement timeline and goals      
      
      Impact on Financial Security:
      Having a 403(b) plan helps build a financial cushion for your retirement years, providing a stream of income when you may no longer be working. This ensures financial stability and the ability to maintain your desired lifestyle.
      Personal Strategy: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on your financial situation and retirement goals. Take advantage of catch-up contributions if you are over 50 to boost your retirement savings.
  - question: What is the Acid Test Ratio?
    answer: >
      The Acid Test Ratio, also known as the quick ratio, measures a company’s ability to pay off its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. It is calculated by dividing the sum of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable by current liabilities. A ratio above 1 indicates that a company can cover its short-term obligations without selling inventory.

      Impact on Financial Health:
      For personal finance, understanding the acid test ratio of a company can help you make informed investment decisions. A strong ratio suggests the company is financially stable and can meet its short-term obligations, reducing your investment risk.
      Personal Strategy: Use the acid test ratio as one of the criteria when evaluating potential stocks to invest in. Aim for companies with a ratio above 1, indicating they have good liquidity and are less likely to face financial distress.

      Impact on Cash Flow Management:
      The acid test ratio can also serve as a model for your personal cash flow management. Ensuring that you have enough liquid assets to cover your short-term liabilities helps maintain financial stability.
      Personal Strategy: Maintain an emergency fund that covers at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund should be easily accessible and not tied up in long-term investments or illiquid assets.
  - question: What are investments?
    answer: >
      Investments are assets or items acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. Common forms of investments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, and commodities. Investing is a key component of personal finance, aimed at growing wealth over time and achieving financial goals.

      Impact on Wealth Accumulation:
      Strategic investments can significantly impact your long-term wealth accumulation. By investing in assets that appreciate over time or generate income, you can grow your financial portfolio and achieve your financial goals faster.
      Personal Strategy: Diversify your investments to spread risk and increase potential returns. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing assets to invest in, and regularly review and adjust your portfolio.

      Impact on Financial Security:
      Investments provide a means to build financial security by creating multiple income streams and growing your net worth. This can protect you against inflation, economic downturns, and unexpected expenses.
      Personal Strategy: Start investing early to take advantage of compound interest. Use tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to maximize your returns and reduce your tax liability. Reinvest dividends and interest to enhance your portfolio growth.
  - question: What is the Homestead Exemption?
    answer: >
      The homestead exemption is a legal provision that helps reduce the property taxes owed on a homeowner’s primary residence by excluding a portion of the home’s value from taxation. The amount of the exemption varies by state and can provide significant savings for homeowners.

      Impact on Property Taxes:
      Claiming the homestead exemption can lower your property tax bill, freeing up funds for other financial needs or investments. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals on fixed incomes or those looking to manage their housing costs.
      Personal Strategy: Apply for the homestead exemption if you qualify, and ensure you understand the specific rules and benefits in your state. Use the savings from reduced property taxes to pay down your mortgage faster or invest in home improvements.

      Impact on Estate Planning:
      The homestead exemption can also play a role in estate planning, as it often provides protection against creditors and can help ensure that your home remains in the family.
      Personal Strategy: Consult with an estate planning attorney to understand how the homestead exemption can protect your assets. Incorporate it into your broader estate planning strategy to maximize the benefits for your heirs.
  - question: What is key rate duration?
    answer: >
      Key rate duration measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in specific maturities on the yield curve. It helps assess the impact of interest rate changes on a bond's value, taking into account different points along the yield curve rather than a single average rate.

      Impact on Bond Investments:
      Understanding key rate duration is crucial for managing the interest rate risk of your bond investments. It allows you to evaluate how changes in interest rates at different maturities will affect your bond portfolio.
      Personal Strategy: Use key rate duration to construct a bond portfolio that aligns with your interest rate outlook and risk tolerance. Consider diversifying across different maturities to balance risk and return.

      Impact on Portfolio Management:
      Key rate duration provides a more nuanced view of interest rate risk, enabling better portfolio management. By analyzing the impact of rate changes at specific maturities, you can make more informed decisions about bond allocation and duration management.
      Personal Strategy: Regularly monitor the key rate durations of your bond holdings and adjust your portfolio as needed to manage interest rate exposure. Use this metric in conjunction with other tools to optimize your fixed-income strategy.

  - question: Where has all the money in the world gone?
    answer: >
      "(relix already hit on some of this)\n\nIt's hard to explain this to a five-year-old,\
      \ because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \n\
      \nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't\
      \ argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)\n\nImagine a pretend world with no money,\
      \ some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money.\
      \ You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff,\
      \ because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through\
      \ this...\n\n- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some\
      \ meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me\
      \ some meat and I'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough,\
      \ I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff\
      \ going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to\
      \ emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \n\n- Now, let's\
      \ say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than\
      \ I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that\
      \ bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel\
      \ of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\"\
      \ You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like\
      \ money. \n\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable\
      \ for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman\
      \ who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish,\
      \ because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time,\
      \ you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except\
      \ a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \n\nNow, you are issuing *debt*:\
      \ a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers\
      \ get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and\
      \ it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker\
      \ gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him\
      \ anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem\
      \ anywhere. \n\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here,\
      \ on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:\n\n\
      - What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all\
      \ the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't\
      \ \"go\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely\
      \ destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value--\
      \ just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely\
      \ destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \n\n-\
      \ The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading\
      \ apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman\
      \ could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially\
      \ if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you\
      \ could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay,\
      \ and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has\
      \ been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange\
      \ for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they\
      \ made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\n\nThe above\
      \ two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and\
      \ probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most\
      \ basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate,\
      \ you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \n\n\
      After the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look\
      \ at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up\
      \ with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible\
      \ third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season\
      \ with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no\
      \ more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now\
      \ there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the\
      \ potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means\
      \ that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate\
      \ than some murkier system."
  - question: Why were American, minimally-skilled, workers able to afford single family
      homes in the 1960s and 1970s, but now they can barely afford apartments for rent?
    answer: "There are lots of misconceptions around this topic.\n\nHome ownership rates\
      \ in general are higher now than in the 70's.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N\n\
      \nThe cost of a house is also not really the plain cost of a house, it's the financing\
      \ cost. And in that regard, people spend less of their disposable income on mortgages\
      \ than they did at any prior point in the last 40 years.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDSP\n\
      \nThat doesn't mean houses haven't become more expensive, but that perception\
      \ is in large parts fueled by the fact that they have become a *lot* more expensive\
      \ in the most desirable places, the big cities that offer high salaries and a\
      \ high standard of living. People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.\n\
      \nAnother thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger\
      \ houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not\
      \ gone up so drastically.\n\nhttps://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/houses2.jpg?x91208\n\
      \nTwo trends are worth noting however.\n\nPeople on average go to college more\
      \ often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also\
      \ get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or\
      \ more, this happens later in life.\n\nAlso, inequality pushes ownership rates\
      \ down for the lower half and up for the upper half.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\
      \nhttps://equitablegrowth.org/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race/\n\
      \nSo, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what\
      \ and where has changed. Not correct in aggregate. Homeownership rates are [higher\
      \ than they were in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/tables/time-series/coh-owner/owner-tab.txt).\
      \ \n\nAlso remember that amenities and size of homes has changed over time. Today\u2019\
      s house is different than 1960\u2019s homes."
  - question: "\"Wealthsimple Inc., a commission-free Canadian online brokerage with\
      \ more than 350,000 clients, is warning traders about the risks of investing in\
      \ certain highly speculative stocks, but isn\u2019t planning to halt trading in\
      \ those shares.\""
    answer: "This is how it should be\n\nThis morning I saw a post from somebody saying\
      \ \n\n\u201CHow do I trade stocks? I don\u2019t even know where to begin but I\

      \nThese people are more than likely going to be the ones left holding the bag\

      \ issue. The sell was open all day. I'm fine with setting warnings, and you could\
      \ argue they have a responsibility to their users to inform them when they're\

      \ start trading on margin with literally no warning or disclaimer about what that\
      \ entailed. Happy to let WSB bros blow up margin accounts to -50k and go bankrupt\

  - question: First Time Investors - If you don't know what to do -- READ This
    answer: Not gonna lie I just started last August and pretty much full sent and went
      with some companies I knew who were do for a good year like Sony especially with
      a new system coming out and so far on about 2k invested I'm up 1200 in about 6
      months which makes me feel good lol.  Have missed out on good opportunities on
      the way which happens though. Hey great article! I heard a fast blurb on the radio
      that Reddit itself is looking for some trader like you to be scouring these stock
      subs for potential gains makers.. I won't swear it was them, but it was a blurb
      on my local radio station.  At any rate.. that could be YOU. You may have other
      great employment,  but.. look into it if you want. Champ. I really appreciate
      this. I just got into Sri is with the whole GME. I started buying basic crypto
      with Coinbase (they give free crypto) and RH (I know they are bad lol) and so
      far got about 200$ in. I mostly bought bigger name brands bc I know they will
      gain in the LONG. Thanks for the post it was amazingly helpful.
  - question: PAID OFF MY HOUSE
    answer: "Congrats friend. \n\nI'm in a similar boat, except I don't currently own\
      \ a house at all. I'm travelling the world but I intend to cash out enough once\
      \ I'm home to buy a house outright rather than enter the rental market again.\n\
      \nI found out about Ethereum at around cost of $1 while selling some old Dogecoin\
      \ on Poloniex. ETH was the hype coin in the trollbox at the time, I'd never heard\
      \ of it. I did some research and decided to convert all my Dogecoin into Ethereum.\
      \ So all thanks to a memecoin which got me into Crypto I'm looking at buying a\
      \ house outright at 29 years old without even having a career or degree. Incredible.\
      \ \n\nThanks Dogecoin.  After the bit about seeing the pic of the private key,\
      \ i totally thought you were going to say you started hanging around the atm to\
      \ try to snap pics of keys and steal enough to pay off a house... lol  \n  \n\
      Anyway, that's an awesome turn of events. Paying off a mortgage super early is\
      \ a huge accomplishment and really makes you feel like a winner. Just make sure\
      \ you're totally square with uncle sam, you don't want fees and insane interest\
      \ to come back and bite you.  \n  \nAnd don't forget to thank your wife for letting\
      \ you take the risk. Congrats OP. \n\nNot sure where you're from, but I'm guessing\
      \ you're going to be paying quite a bit of taxes in the upcoming year?\n\nNonetheless\
      \ though, having a hefty tax bill for  1 year is nothing compared to being tied\
      \ to a mortgage for years and years to come. \n"
  - question: 'GME Dedicated Thread - Breaking: CNBC engages in market manipulation
      - lies about Melvin Capital having already covered positions'
    answer: 'Short Interest still at 66M no way in hell Melvin covered yesterday (citron
      probably did).. the fact a billionaire can go on CNBC and tell lies to manipulate
      a stock for his own personal agenda is the exact reason people are taking a stand.
      Fuck the Suits, GME to Pluto. If CNBC released this statement without appropriate
      vetting and Melvin''s statement ends up being false, two things should happen.
      First, the SEC should investigate any relationship between CNBC and Melvin.
      Second, retail investors should absolutely boycott CNBC. The battle on Wall Street
      between the institutional manipulators and the retail investor may be ongoing,
      but in the battle for who has more eyeballs, the retailers win hands down. How
      does CNBC survive on institutional viewers alone. Remember, this is a once in
      a decade perfect storm of events. You won''t ever see a short squeeze like this
      ever again, because after the fallout from this, regulation of hedge funds is
      imminent.... a short percentage of float of 140% will never ever happen again.
      Hedge funds trying to salvage their losing position by Martingale betting their
      clients money will also never ever happen again.

  - question: Economists, what is the single biggest misconception you feel the "Econ
      101" crowd has about economics in the real world?
    answer: "It is not our fault that your country is mismanaged. \n\nWe don't actually\
      \ predict the future\n\nWe measure, describe uncertainties, model and optimize.\
      \  \n\nEconomists don't really know anything about the weather either. Stop misquoting\
      \ the 10 economists who were selectively surveyed out of the millions that exist.\
      \ It\u2019s seems no one believes in supply and demand anymore. Housing prices\
      \ are caused by too much (or not enough) government intervention. Inflation is\
      \ caused by printing money and not a supply chain crunch. Everyone has another\
      \ issue they think is causing a rise or drop in prices, instead of starting with\
      \ supply and demand and building from there. Economics isn\u2019t about clocking\
      \ in GDP levels, or making sure the stocks are up; it\u2019s prime purpose is\
      \ to help people, and to make them better off. I hear a lot of liberal types say\
      \ that economists fail to understand that people are\u2026. people. That being\
      \ said, a majority of my studies revolve around measuring/improving social welfare,\
      \ and on the theory side, maximizing social welfare. Conversely, conservative\
      \ types seem to get all of their economic ideologies from Micro 101. The problem\
      \ with this, is the policies suggested in introductory courses are made under\
      \ the assumption that the markets are perfectly competitive, which is not typically\
      \ the case in the real world."
  - question: I am a failed real estate investor. Here's what I learned.
    answer: "Property Manager that looks after 600+ units here.\n\nNot to rub salt in\
      \ OP's wound, I appreciate that he had the courage to post this.  But all of this\
      \ is completely avoidable.\n\nWould a write up on how to choose a Property Manager\
      \ be warranted on this sub?  \n\n\nEdit:\n\n[How to Choose a Good Property Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/hgmiqp/how_to_choose_a_good_property_manager/)\
      \ I am an active investor(and agent) and can agree that there are some major difficulties\
      \ and you certainly do have to assess and be comfortable with the risk involved.\
      \  From your story it sounds like your property manager was a disaster.  That\
      \ is not surprising at all.  It\u2019s a hard job and most property managers are\
      \ terrible.  They can make or break your experience.  A secondary problem seems\
      \ to be the condition of the properties.  Stuff breaks, that is par for the course.\
      \  However, when you purchase and go through the inspection process you should\
      \ have some idea how much you will be spending on repairs.  Current repairs and\
      \ future capital expenditures should be in your budget.  I buy to renovate and\
      \ expect low out of pocket expenses in the first few years after renovation. \
      \ I prefer to spend the money up front and save some future headaches, plus this\
      \ helps me drive up the value of my properties.  If you buy a property with a\
      \ lot of differed maintenance or where many of the major systems are at/near the\
      \ end of their useful life then you have to be prepared for regular large expenditures\
      \ until the major systems are more up to date.  In my opinion your agent should\
      \ have prepared you a little more for that but not all agents know investing.\
      \  Sorry to hear it didn\u2019t go as well as you had hoped.  Thanks for sharing\
      \ your story! I think it is the relationship between Property Manager and investor.\
      \ Both have different goals and I believe an antagonistic relationship. PM makes\
      \ money when investor is screwed. I have seen excitement only when there is repairs\
      \ involved. I also feel a lot of PMs are in the property game. The better tenants\
      \ with good scores and jobs do not even make it to you and will land with the\
      \ PMs personal property. Not always the case but I think a possibility. Motto\
      \ is to stay local if possible. Control is everything. Being able to drive and\
      \ verify repairs and get multiple quotes is important."

  - question: Is a stock market crash like the ones in 1929 and 2008 impending?
    answer: "On this subreddit we mods don't like predictions about stock-market crashes.\
      \ They are notoriously tricky, for the reason already given by another commenter.\n\
      \nIt is fairly easy though, to explain why the current situation is so troubling.\
      \ I'm going to concentrate on that.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Federal Reserve\
      \ performed very expansionary monetary policy. Other Central Banks across the\
      \ world did something similar. As it turned out that policy was too expansionary.\
      \ Inflation was caused by various factors including pandemic-induced supply chain\
      \ problems and the expansionary monetary policy.\n\nAs a result, inflation has\
      \ been high for quite a while now. Over on /r/badeconomics Integralds gives [the\
      \ path of the CPI price-level compared to the Fed's aim](https://i.imgur.com/Pfn9szI.png).\
      \ The price level is now far higher than the Fed's intended path. Since 2020 inflation\
      \ has averaged 5.25% rather than the 2% aim. If inflation went to 0% next month\
      \ and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's\
      \ intended price-level path.\n\nThis leads us to the current problems. The Fed\
      \ must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply\
      \ or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary.\
      \ It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.\n\nThis affects\
      \ the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow\
      \ less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators\
      \ can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become\
      \ a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only\
      \ the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)\n\
      \nWhen thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already\
      \ declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year.\
      \ Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market\
      \ fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that,\
      \ but conventional economics does not give an answer. If it was possible to know\
      \ the stock market would crash, it would have already crashed. \n\nIf I have a\
      \ stock, and I know for certain the market will crash, then I would sell the stock\
      \ and either buy it again when it's cheaper or do something else with the money.\
      \ If investors all do this however, the stock will crash because everyone is selling.\
      \ Therefore it's not possible to know that the stock market will crash unless\
      \ you know something that the large portion of investors don't. 1929 and 2008\
      \ were both financial crises, which doesn\u2019t just mean \u201Ca very bad recession\u201D\
      \ but actually has a specific meaning.\n\n1929 initially started as a market decline\
      \ on a similar path to todays (though on a much shakier ground because of lack\
      \ of regulation). When the market did decline, however, the Federal Reserve made\
      \ all the wrong moves, abandoning credit lines and causing a moderate recession\
      \ to turn into a bad one."
  - question: How To Become a Consistent Profitable Trader (My Favourite Set Up)
    answer: 'I have been slowly trying to learn more about day trading over the past
      several months, and man, this was the most concise, simplified write up I have
      seen.  Thank you!  Just a quick question, it sounds like you hold positions overnight

      outside if trading hours?  Obviously, as you said, you should analyze and try
      to improve upon strategies.  Thanks again!! Yes, this is a good method, and is
      also known as a base breakout.
      "The longer the base, the higher in space"
      What I''m curious to know is how you handle false breakouts. Stock goes up, gets
      met with huge resistance and comes back down. I find it actually happens quite
      often. How do you navigate this? Thanks for the info. Very helpful for a beginner
      like me. My question is: once you''ve creating a list based on volume, RSI and
      proximity to ATH, how do you parce out the stocks worth taking a risk on? Or how
      do you judge how big a risk a stock is worth?'

  - question: "Why is the financial sector able to maintain such high wages and profits\
      \ compared to other professional services sectors? Why doesn\u2019t this attract\
      \ more competition that results in wages and profit margins being forced down?"
    answer: "For the investing industry, there is actually a fair amount of competition.\
      \ The average hedge fund [only lasts for five years](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/07/31/1913792/most-hedge-funds-fail/),\
      \ while [the average mutual fund fares marginally better at 8.6.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/can-mutual-fund-get-better-age/)\
      \ The comparison of compensation scheme to structural engineers is rather unfair:\
      \ a construction company is done once the building is complete, while a hedge\
      \ fund continues to actively manage your money the entire time you keep it with\
      \ them, so charging a percentage of the total assets every year is much more warranted.\
      \ However, you're right that the infamous 2 and 20 is exorbitant. The good news\
      \ is that competition is working! [Fees are declining, with only 30% insisting\
      \ on the traditional 2 and 20.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/only-a-third-of-hedge-funds-charge-2-and-20-fees-says-expert-1541851200)\
      \ More generally, thanks to competition from low cost index funds, [money is drastically\
      \ flowing away from actively managed funds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/outflows-inflows-active-passive-stock-funds-51571439212),\
      \ and some of their largest clients like the [California pension system](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pensions-calpers-hedgefunds/calpers-dumps-hedge-funds-citing-cost-to-pull-4-billion-stake-idUSKBN0HA2D120140916)\
      \ have sworn off hedge funds. It took a while, but over time, the sheen of active\
      \ management and their (usually unfulfilled) promises of outperforming the market\
      \ has worn off, and they're being competed away by lower cost alternatives.\n\n\
      As for investment banking, the relevant competitive angle is relationships with\
      \ the CFOs and CEOs at potential client companies. Large firms like Goldman Sachs\
      \ or Morgan Stanley provide enough continuity that new entrants into the investment\
      \ banking industry can develop those relationships as they rise up the ranks,\
      \ so that by the time they become managing directors they are already chummy with\
      \ their decision making counterparts. And indeed, most of a managing director's\
      \ time is spent not doing market research or detailed quantitative analysis but\
      \ instead [cultivating their relationships with clients](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-career-path/)\
      \ so that when a CFO is contemplating a capital raise or M&amp;A transaction,\
      \ the name they know and trust is yours. The idea that competition is based not\
      \ around price or competence but rather networking may be gauche, but for better\
      \ or worse it's how the industry works. And because those relationships are very\
      \ scarce, the people who have them are able to extract large rents.\n\nAll that\
      \ said, there *is* competition in the investment banking industry, and even new\
      \ entrants! Most new entrants are what's called [\"boutique investment banks.\"\
      ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique_investment_bank) Such banks are usually\
      \ founded by a former managing director at a large who has decided that he can\
      \ leverage his relationships without the corporate name to help him; for example,\
      \ [Qatalyst, one of the most prominent investment banks for the tech industry,\
      \ was founded by Frank Quattrone, who was a former star managing director at Morgan\
      \ Stanley's tech investment banking group in Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quattrone).\

      \ deals that a boutique bank facilitates."
  - question: Wikipedia has a section arguing that supply and demand isn't real, or
      no longer applies. Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?
    answer: "Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews\
      \ much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe. It also tends\
      \ to misrepresent orthodox economics and be weirdly out of touch with modern economics\
      \ (note how most of the people the article cites are heterodox economists, economists\
      \ from the 1970's or earlier and no modern, mainstream economist is cited). Anyways,\
      \ in order:\n\n1. No, economic theory makes very sharp predictions about how we\
      \ think markets will react to exogenous shocks (prices rise when a hurricane destroys\
      \ crops is a testable prediction). And yes, we can measure supply and demand curves.\

      \ goods (again see the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/qflpw6/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory/)\
      \ for empirical validation of core microeconomic theory). The administrative prices\
      \ argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they\
      \ set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin\
      \ on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that\
      \ are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased\
      \ taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition\
      \ firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the\
      \ same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable\
      \ firms survive) &gt;Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?\n\nNo.\
      \ But we can expand on that a bit.\n\nSupply and demand is a model. Models are\
      \ approximations of reality. Whether a model is a good approximation of realty\
      \ in any specific application depends on how well the particular market you're\
      \ studying lines up with the assumptions of the model. For example, S&amp;D assumes\
      \ that (a) everyone knows what they're buying, (b) every firm in the market is\
      \ selling basically the same good, and (c) there are many buyers and sellers,\
      \ so that no one customer or firm has outsized influence on the good's price.\
      \ Some markets satisfy those conditions; others do not.\n\nSupply and demand is\
      \ a general framework that can be used to study a wide variety of market phenomena.\
      \ However, if you are studying a specific market at a specific time in a specific\
      \ place, then you might want to use a more detailed model that better conforms\
      \ to the application under investigation.\n\nThere is an entire field of economics,\
      \ *industrial organization,* that studies the behavior of supply in situations\
      \ where the assumptions of supply and demand are not a good approximation for\
      \ reality. This includes situations in which there are few competitors (monopoly,\
      \ oligopoly); situations in which competitors compete on brand (monopolistic competition),\
      \ situations in which one firm's actions depend on the actions of others (game\
      \ theory), etc. All of these models allow for a more detailed analysis than simple\
      \ S&amp;D. \n\nUsually S&amp;D should be the first place you go to solve your\
      \ problem, but not necessarily the last place. You can use S&amp;D to get coarse\
      \ answers to most questions, and more detailed models to get richer answers. \n\
      \n-----\n\nRegarding the two criticisms you mentioned:\n\n1. S&amp;D is not a\
      \ tautology; classical consumer and producer theory produces implications that\
      \ can be tested against data."
  - question: What do economists know now that they didn't 50 years ago?
    answer: "Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would\
      \ be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced\
      \ data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods\
      \ emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their\
      \ own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good\
      \ example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability\
      \ to expand knowledge of industrial methods.\n\nAnother major growth area has\
      \ been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since\
      \ the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate\
      \ in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam\
      \ Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged\
      \ in the last 30 or so years.\n\nFinally, changes to the structure of the global\
      \ economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s,\
      \ has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency.\
      \ Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange\
      \ rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange\
      \ rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.). For the most part\
      \ though, computation may arguably one of the biggest contributors to facilitating\
      \ modern advancements as far as I'm aware. Economics is *very* different than\
      \ it was 50 years ago. Microeconomics, for instance, has undergone a drastic shift.\
      \ Microeconomic theory in the 1970s was very much what you might call \"classical\"\
      \ microeconomic theory- there was still a large focus on consumer and producer\
      \ theory that underpins general equilibrium, and decision theory was still an\
      \ active subfield. \n\nSince then, microeconomics evolved; many of the issues\
      \ in decision theory were worked on and resolved (or at least resolved enough\
      \ that economists figured further inquiry would be largely mathematical exercises\
      \ of little real interest). Further, game theory rose to forefront of microeconomic\
      \ theory and took over the field and has *almost* gotten to the point of exhausting\
      \ it's traditional lines of inquiry (e.g. game theorists have moved away from\
      \ a lot of traditional approaches to mechanism design to focus instead on more\
      \ exotic approaches that yield \"worse case\" bounds or robust mechanisms; good\
      \ examples of this would be the work of Bergemann or Brooks). Behavioral and Experimental\
      \ economics (in many ways deeply related to microeconomic theory) became a field,\
      \ and some of the results (such as Vernon Smith's stock market experiments with\
      \ ASU undergrads) were deeply shocking to the field (among other things, this\
      \ experiment exhibited evidence of bubbles arising even in relatively simple settings).\
      \ \n\nEconometrics evolved as well. For one, in the most recent two or three decades,\
      \ there's been an explosion of interest in causality on all levels. This means\
      \ on a philosophical level, on an estimation level, on an implementation level,\
      \ and in specific particularized applied problems. This has led to drastic advances\
      \ in econometric methods, giving the applied researcher a very powerful toolbox\
      \ as well as something of a guide to best practices in experimental implementation\
      \ (thanks to the work of people like Duflo and Banerjee in doing so many experiments\
      \ and learning the good practices the hard way). The combination of this interest\
      \ in experiments, good guidelines, and strong tools for estimation has allowed\
      \ us to answer questions we would have found impossible to answer before: what\
      \ is the impact of UBI? Which aid programs to developing countries are most effective\
      \ at increasing health outcomes? etc."

  - question: Why didn't Buffett sell when rate hikes were first announced?
    answer: "For Buffett, sell to who? He's got a $300B portfolio, he can't just wake\
      \ up one monday and say I should get out of the market, and be out by Thursday.\
      \ It's a many month process to get out without crushing the prices of stocks he's\
      \ selling. Burry only manages about $1B, he can get out in a couple weeks. \n\n\
      Secondly, Buffett has never said he believes he can predict the market. What if\
      \ inflation had been transitory? What if the Fed stopped raising rates?\n\nPersonally\
      \ I have been preaching we are headed for a huge bear market for over a year,\
      \ and even now think we aren't even close to the bottom. But I've stayed fully\
      \ invested because I believe what I own is at a large discount to their intrinsic\
      \ value, even with higher rates. But I'm not buying large caps either. You keep\
      \ saying this isn\u2019t timing the market, but this is literally the definition\
      \ of timing the market. You are trying to enter and exit in accordance with market\
      \ movement predictions. \n\nThat\u2019s what timing the market MEANS. This is\
      \ like asking why a farmer doesn't sell his business because winter is coming,\
      \ why a retailer doesn't sell after Christmas. A value investor knows these things\
      \ happen and values the business averaged over the cycle, and doesn't panic because\
      \ a trough has arrived, just as any other sensible business owner."
  - question: Why is Nvidia Valued so much higher than Intel?

      \nINTC got too big and took too long to respond to the challengers and INTC has\

  - question: Is it wrong to assume that Canada's economy will become slow in future
      years because of the housing costs?
    answer: 'Absolutely, and for more reasons than just that:
      - When homeowners earn more from their house than their job, that job seems less
      worthy of their valuable time
      - When it''s become more attractive to go into real estate than, say, engineering
      or entrepreneurship, you can expect fewer engineers and entrepreneurs, and those
      entrepreneurs that remain will be running startups in the real estate industry
      (ie, Key Living Corp)
      - And as long as the bubble continues, expect it to soak up more investment capital
      like a black hole, resulting in less investment available to productive endeavours
      or disruptive innovations
      - It will also get more expensive to run businesses, as more and more of your
      revenue gets allocated to the ground under your factory and the ground under your
      workers'' beds
      - When it''s more expensive to start a family, expect fewer children
      - If the bubble truly never pops, expect immigration to eventually slow down too,
      as Canada becomes more expensive and less attractive
      - And if it does pop, well, the picture might get a lot brighter, but only after
      a period of deep darkness as our mistakes catch up to us Its not just that....
      keys workers like police  officers nurses teachers fireman etc. wont be able to
      afford something in the city so they will move out too seen this shit in UK its
      exactly gives me dejavu . Real estate agents should not be allowed to charge a
      percentage of a sale price. They drive prices higher because it benefits them.  By
      mandating that real estate agencies have a set fee, their sale model will turn
      to volume instead of value. This will have the effect of leveling off the market.'
  - question: Bought a hotel, converted to apartments $0 down
    answer: "Congratulations. I was just reading up on a program in Oklahoma for children\

      \nI am not understanding how there is such a failure between the way the GOVERNMENT\

      \ now it\u2019s a pitiful mess There\u2019s been a few comments that were surprised\
      \ we can charge $850 per month. So just to lay out the housing situation in my\
      \ area, it\u2019s bad. There\u2019s a few trailer parks that are charging between\
      \ 1000 and 1200 per month, for single wide trailers that take an additional 5\
      \ to 800 per month in electric to heat and cool. Over the winter three different\
      \ homes have burnt down because they are poorly maintained, built in the 70s,\
      \ roughly 900 square-foot. A single-family home starts at 1600 per month to rent.\
      \ There are a few 2 bed apartments that are in the $1100 per month range, and\
      \ they were waiting list of over 100 people. They also don\u2019t take vouchers\
      \ :-/\n\nThe Housing Authority and nonprofits currently spend $85 per night on\
      \ rooms at a few hotels. So over $2,500 a month for similar housing. They were\
      \ thrilled to be paying $850 for a year solution.\n\nThe people who are on disability\
      \ and also receiving a voucher are also thrilled to be spending $50 out of pocket,\
      \ and have all of their utilities covered. We are paying for the electric, gas,\
      \ Internet, TV, septic, water, and trash. It keeps their cost-of-living low, So\
      \ they\u2019re no longer choosing between heating the house medicine and food."
  - question: Your health is your most valuable investment.
    answer: 'But is it really the case the eating healthy is more expensive? The cheapest
      products one can buy are veggies and fruits (of course it depends on the period
      of the year which ones are cheaper). Usually the food which is expensive is the
      "fake healthy" stuff and the organic food. Organic food is a scam, and if done
      correctly, it is also unsustainable. Could not agree more. This is something I
      do not understand when people skip out on. Good quality, enjoyable food and drink,
      as well as good health are of paramount importance for a good quality of life.
      You should not go cheap on that. That is the core investment by itself, because
      without it, what is everything else worth?
      Importantly, eating healthy is also not necessarily more expensive. Eating out
      is expensive, eating super processed foods is expensive. Eating out I can understand
      for the experience and socializing, but the processed foods are dead to me. Just
      skip out on the all the processed bullshit and super sugary stuff (sugar is way
      more screwed up than fat) and get started on a balanced diet. By balanced diet,
      I mean eat everything. Unless you have a very specific goal and know what you
      are doing, following a restrictive diet is almost always an expensive mistake.
      Eat what you love every day, but keep switching it up. Cook using basic ingredients
      and make something awesome; cooking is the most rewarding hobby. Treat yourself
      and have a glass of wine or drink every day. You don''t have to buy organic, it
      is an unsustainable scam for the most part anyway. Try to buy local instead. If
      you''re vegetarian or vegan, the processed foods are crazy expensive and not very
      healthy, so try to avoid them -- have them for convenience only. If you''re a
      meat eater, buying ground meat in bulk and putting it portioned in the freezer
      is cheap and goes a long way. In any case, eating fresh beats eating processed
      all day every day.
      Exercise your body and get into fitness. Don''t aim for Arnold, aim to be able
      to run a couple of km/miles and lift weights on an intermediate level and do it
      twice a week. You will feel so much healthier and it will also help you clear
      your mind. A decent pair of running shoes and gym pass for a year will cost you
      but a couple of shares of VT a year. Good fresh food, no unecessary take outs,
      cut expenses that don''t matter, increase expenses in things that matter, constant
      DCA in MSCI World, buy more when in a dip. Be constant, stay the course, never
      stop learning. Best investment is in yourself. Raise the intrinsic value of yourself.'
  - question: "McDonald\u2019s is spending nearly $1 billion in 2019 to add ordering\
      \ kiosks and other tech to stores."
    answer: 'IMO the money here is the ability for the kiosks to upsell compared to
      humans taking your order. I''m sure they have data showing the average order size
      is larger through a kiosk than human.
      Kiosks let you browse the menu better and with photos of all items, they can try
      to upsell you to make it a meal, upsize, etc 100% of the time, they can push promotions
      and specials, they encourage browsing more of the menu as there''s less of a time
      crunch to complete your order. All around I think it''s a great move for the long
      run. I love those kiosks. Far better than standing in line waiting for a dude
      with five kids to make up their minds about what they want and to change their
      minds twenty times.
      It''s also immensely better than getting to the counter only to have to wait for
      the person behind the counter to wrap up his or her flirting with their co-workers
      or to fill the register back up with change or some other silly housekeeping activity.
      Less human interaction, the better. I feel like Kiosks in fast food are like ATMs
      were in banking.
      Everyone thought ATMs were going to kill all bank-telling jobs, but instead those
      tellers have been somewhat re-purposed.

  - question: Buying an expensive car
    answer: "You will always want the next shiny thing.  As long as you are buying your\
      \ cars right thats not a bad thing.  \n\nFor example.  Last year I bought a used\
      \ 2019 M5 completion with 2000 miles on it.  Sticker price was $148k.  I paid\
      \ $105k.  Sold it after a a year for $95k.  That was $800 month for a very expensive\
      \ car.  \n\nIn 2017 I bought a new Acura NSX with a $190k sticker for $135 k brand\
      \ new after dealers were discounting the hell out of then.   I have 14k mile son\
      \ it and current retail on it is about $125k.  Thats a lot of fun for $10k.\n\n\
      I can afford full price brand new cars but I also know I am going to want to trade\
      \ in often.  If my cost is $1500 per month or less I\u2019m happy. \n\nBuy whatever\
      \ you want.  Just get a good deal on it and if you get bored you can justify the\
      \ loss by looking at how much it cost you to enjoy it. I bought a Lamborghini\
      \ at the end of last year and it's going to be delivered in June! It is my dream\
      \ car to own since I was a kid and I told myself I would get it when I was finally\
      \ fatfired.\n\nInitially, I didn't pull the trigger even when we passed 8 figures\
      \ NW as I've been living abroad without the need for a car. Covid-19 forced us\
      \ to come back to the US and it made me think of my limited time on this earth.\
      \ No regrets on my end.  Would have liked to wait for a perfectly speced preowned\
      \ performante to show up but the secondary market has been limited so decided\
      \ to say fuck it and pull the trigger and got all the options I wanted. I've purchased\
      \ a Huracan LP610-4, Murci\xE9lago LP640, and am in the market for a Ferrari 458\
      \ Spider. I do not regret the decision.\n\nFor me cars have been important most\
      \ of my life. I was raised around them, and my social circles and community are\
      \ based around them. I have met some of my closest friends through related events,\
      \ and numerous networking opportunities given the successful nature of the people\
      \ high end cars tend to attract. That being said, I would have made the same decisions\
      \ even without the networking options for the simple fact that these machines\
      \ bring happiness that I feel is worth their relative-financial impact to me.\n\
      \nThe most important thing is that you go into the situation with eyes wide open.\
      \ For example, the maintenance between my first and second Lamborghini was an\
      \ order of magnitude different. But I knew this going into it. So when the Murci\xE9\
      lago's transmission decided it no longer wanted to live a few months into ownership,\
      \ the impact to my wallet and mental health was substantially tempered. I also\
      \ personally don't care about owning a *new* car, so I do a lot of research ahead\
      \ of time to get into a model/year that is in a healthier portion of its depreciation\
      \ curve. [Four Wheel Trader](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvuqaQ4IyACFWmR0E-aBouQ)\
      \ on YouTube can help with that.\n\nRegarding the \"next shiny thing\", the [hedonic\
      \ treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) is a very real thing.\
      \ I found that when I daily-drove my Huracan (because it was so easy), it quickly\
      \ became less special, and my BMW M3 seemed really boring. When I got the Murci\xE9\
      lago I was forced to pace myself more, and only take it out sometimes. This dramatically\
      \ improved the \"keeping it special\" feeling. This is all obvious I'm sure seeing\
      \ it written out, but it's worth repeating."
  - question: Is the gaming/e-sport area a good investment?
    answer: 'Esports is overhyped right now and not seeing returns. Don''t touch with
      a tenfoot pole any company that calls itself "esports" because even the esports
      industry is struggling to actually get money out of the market. Also, very little
      is public; most of the promise is in venture capital.
      Gaming, however, is pretty solid. The big guys - Tencent, Activision, Microsoft,
      EA, Nintendo, Sony, Ubisoft etc - all are doing very well on fundamentals and
      gaming expanded its audience over the pandemic anyway. Activision \*may\* have
      some pushback regarding the recent lawsuit but I also tend to know that many people
      on the internet will say one thing and do another, and the biggest scandals aren''t
      necessarily pushed out to the broader community.
      The big guys diversify their portfolio enough to absorb any "failures" in their
      gaming offerings. The smaller ones are more susceptible to risk. Depending on
      what you want to do with the stock, you could just buy the big guys and leave
      it or trade around on the smaller folks. I haven''t researched ESPO, but what
      I can tell you is that investing in companies that make video games is very risky.
      Take something like CDPR for example. For years they''ve been treated like heroes
      and the saviors of the gaming world and then their whole reputation (and with
      that, their stock price) came from an all time high, to a massive, still continuing
      drop just cause of one game.
      Something like Nvidia or AMD would be a relatively safe investment in my opinion.
      Both companies are doing great and as long as there''s demand for consoles, computers,
      AI, etc. (which there most definitely is), then their stock prices will perform
      well. My suggestion would be not to do it at the moment, the gaming sector is
      over valued at the moment (what isnt). I have been investing in it regularly from
      February and I''m in the red with it (its only 5% of my etfs) and beating myself
      for not putting it into SP500 or world stocks.'
  - question: Should we start focusing on Financial and Energy companies?
    answer: 'Choose your own adventure:
      A viable vaccine is approved before the end of the year and sees widespread distribution
      through 2021 and the economy quickly rebounds.
      Or
      The drying up of cheap private financing kills off many marginal companies, which
      has a snowball effect and drives the economy into a deep recession followed by
      a slow recovery as we saw with the last financial crisis. Possibly even worse
      because the government hasn''t really reset the levers it used from last time.
      I remember a month ago lloyds dropped below 25p a share and the idiots on here
      said "don''t buy this dinosaur stock its a value trap".
      Right now you''d be up 15.76%, I know because I bought some.
      My Natwest up 24.68%.
      Do what you want, follow your gut, just don''t over leverage yourself. Someone
      was recommending JP Morgan Chase the other day so I had a look.
      My problem with banks, and financials in general, is they are total black boxes.
      I mean all these scandals come out about banks like [this](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/10/03/jpmorgan-chase-faces-a-fine-of-920m-for-market-manipulation)
      and [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54225572) and it feels like they come
      out of nowhere. Is it even possible as an investor to understand the business
      well enough to see these things coming?
      In 2008 loads of them tanked because they''d been lending much too generously,
      but very few people saw any warning signs.
      So yeah I think for me I personally avoid individual bank stocks (would happily
      own some as part of a broad etf) because I don''t think it''s possible to understand
      what is happening, even if you spend a lot of time researching them.'
  - question: Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear.
      DD Inside.
    answer: "As a PhD in power systems with heavy emphasis on EVs, I don't think hydrogen\
      \ fuel cells are going to be as big as a lot of people hope. I also think EV stocks\
      \ are a pretty big bubble (though I did make 1000% on 4k of TSLA over the years).\
      \ From my education and 10 years of working in the power sector, I would say you\
      \ want to look for companies making stationary battery systems (other than TSLS\
      \ cause bubble) and other distributed energy resources. That's what I'm seeing\
      \ in the industry in a big way. That's the job that I have, integrating these.\
      \ For solar picks, $TSLA is also a play. While they are a tech company, they are\
      \ all about green energy, even bought a solar company. It has been rocky for that\
      \ side of their business, but it's a play. Plus you get all the upside of Elon\
      \ tweeting about nonsense, and the cars I guess. I would recommend people to not\
      \ invest in anything hydrogen related. There hasn't been any significant developments\
      \ the last decade when it comes to producing hydrogen cost-efficently. \n\nA hydrogen\
      \ vehicle basically has a hydrogen powerplant inside it which produces electricity\
      \ powering the car. But the amount of electricity required to produce hydrogen\
      \ is tremendous compared to the amount of electricity needed to run an EV, so\
      \ why not just get an EV then?"
  - question: Buy vs Rent
    answer: If you're looking at comparable properties and it's 1300 to rent and 2000
      for a mortgage I would %100 rent. Your rent is the most you'll pay. Your mortgage
      is the least you'll pay. I'm not super experienced at this so take it with a grain
      of salt. But I'm mostly looking for places to buy that have a mortgage payment
      around half of what they would rent for. That way I can budget for repairs/capex,
      etc. So I'd be looking to buy for 1000/mo instead of renting for 2000/mo.
  - question: A budget for the newly single
    answer: 'I''ll typically try to extrapolate by small data points.
      For example: if my commute changes, first see how many days it takes to get to
      a quarter tank then multiply by 4.  30 divided by this number and that''ll tell
      you how many tanks per month you need to fill. Kinda a simple estimate, but it''ll
      get you to a ballpark. Depending on how nerdy you want to me, you may also consider
      average estimated miles driven and compare to your cars MPG rating (minus maybe
      10% because dealers inflate this) to get a #gallons used per month estimate.
      Similar situation with food: tell yourself you''ll only buy food for one week,
      try to eat only that food, then extrapolate that out by multiplying by rougly
      4.5 (cuz 30d in a month not 28).
      For utilities, if you''re in a new-to-you house, you could call the utility companies
      and they''ll tell you average monthly spend from previous tenants.
      Keep in mind, the smaller sample size you use for estimates, the greater the potential
      variability (i.e. extrapolating from one week doesn''t factor in buying salt or
      dish soap in your grocery budget because you don''t buy them every week), but
      it should get you a rough estimate to help you plan moving forward.'
  - question: Investments tracker
    answer: 'It really fiddly to track if you have a portfolio held with different providers,
      leaving you to have to manually enter whatever holdings you had into a separate
      app for tracking purposes.
      I personally use Google Sheets to keep tabs on Pensions and investments as you
      can use their Finance formula to get realtime prices.  I know it''s not an app
      you were looking for, but their iOS app really does the job.
      I got the P/L figures lined up just how I like them.  It''s also the only way
      I''ve found in tracking provider fees.'
  - question: I'm selling my GOLD for Bitcoin. Here's why
    answer: 'I think government''s will always prefer their own digital currency/blockchain
      above Bitcoin or anything else that''s open source and decentralized. They''ll
      never give their current forms of control away freely. They''d consider starting
      a complete new fiat currency before going all in on something they don''t have
      control over. The only gold worth having is actual physical gold.
      If you buy gold on an exchange you don''t own gold, you couldnt cash it in for
      a bar. That one piece of gold is being sold many times over, bankers just can''t
      help themselves.
      This can''t happen with bitcoin and it should be what the world uses going forward.
      Whether it will or not, I am not so sure. The wealthy benefit from a system that
      doesnt work or make any sense.'
  - question: Wolfram alpha just became one of my primary investment tools.
    answer: "Careful though. Wolfram Alpha's datafeed only has price return data, not\

      \ the results. e.g. CAT is up 247% over the last 10 years in price, but 339% in\
      \ total return (dividends not reinvested, pre-tax). Brilliant. Did some googling,\

  - question: I trained a deep learning model to find the best investments.
    answer: 'Not an expert.
      But I think your approach is overly ambitious. Maybe it''s possible. But very
      ambitious. What you are trying to do is using fundamental indicators for 3/4 of
      1000 companies, and correlate them to their next year gain. Then use that model
      to try to predict the performance of 1/4 of 1000 companies. It may work if you
      are clever enough. But why would you expect it to work? They are different companies,
      in different sectors, with different expected balance sheets, etc. For example,
      it''s expected that REITs pay more dividends than others, you can''t use that
      to predict the next year movements when you train REITs companies to predict non
      REITs companies. As you notice correctly, the model just overfits your training
      data.
      Well it''s validating, not prediction.
      Here is a naive way to improve this. Group them by sectors, and do the same on
      each sector. Maybe it makes a little more sense since you can assume some sort
      of similarities between the companies in the same group. But not much.
      Another less naive way is look within history of a company. Use historic indicators
      to train and correlate them to the next period gain. Let''s assume you can look
      at indicators per earnings report, so period is quarterly. You can train 3/4 and
      validate 1/4 to see if it has any prediction value. Per a company, there may not
      much to train, but that''s something you have to work with. Suppose it has some
      prediction value for a subset of companies, you can then use your model to choose
      the best assets to invest depending on the result for each company, say rank them
      from high return to low return. Of course, you are gonna have a bunch of models
      to store, thousands of them. And if none of those models have any prediction value,
      well as I said, I''m not an expert.
      I''m interested to know your follow up though if you decide to do any follow up
      experiment. I''m far from an expert but it is naive to believe that you''d be
      able to create a model that performs well using only H2O AI especially without
      understanding anything about how the underlying technology works.
      Here''s where you could improve:
      * You need at *least* 10x more training data, ideally 100x or even 1000x more.
      * Use cross validation instead of throwing away 25% of your training data.
      * Apply normalization functions to your momentum indicators, overlap studies,
      volatility and volume indicators.  Without this your model will **NEVER** converge.
      * Use an activation function that is better suited to the feature bounds such
      as tanh.
      * Use either a "long short-term memory" network or better yet a "generative adversarial
      network".  Regression is a dead end.
      * Input dropout should always be zero.
      * Hidden layer dropouts are likely far too low.
      * The quantity and size of the hidden layers doesn''t make sense.
      * Instead of using a fixed number of epochs you should continue training until
      the accuracy of the validation set reaches an acceptable threshold.
      * Save your training progress along the way in case your model overfits and you
      overwrite a better performing model.
      Even after addressing all of these things your model will still most likely struggle
      to predict downturns.  Better indicators than your standard ADX, AROON, MACD,
      RSI, TRIMA, ATR etc will be required to overcome this hurdle operating on numerous
      time frames.
      Best of luck and happy model hunting.'

      to your browser to automatically apply any coupon codes or discounts when you
      checkout. If there's no discount, enter your details, abadon your cart and then
      many places will email you a discount code in a day's time. Think of how long
      you need to work to make back the money you spend. A $1000 camera, thats a few
      weeks of work. $80 new shirt you want but dont really need? Thats 2 days of work
      etc. Don't use it for everything or you'll go mad. Use it to sense check if you

  - question: what is a bankers accpetance rate and why does it matter?
    answer: What Is a Banker's Acceptance Rate? Banker's acceptances are assumed to be safe 
      investments because they're backed by the bank so they often trade at a discount to face value. 
      The banker's acceptance rate is the market rate at which these instruments trade.
