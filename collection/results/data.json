        "question": "Where has all the money in the world gone?",
        "answer": "(relix already hit on some of this)\n\nIt's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \n\nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)\n\nImagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...\n\n- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \n\n- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. \n\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \n\nNow, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. \n\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:\n\n- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't \"go\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \n\n- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\n\nThe above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \n\nAfter the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. \n\nNow we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"bond\"...\n\n(continued in a reply to this post...)\n\n Here's some way of thinking about it, and I'm not really sure if it's completely correct, but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old :)\n\nSay there are two people in the world. You and me. We both have $100. A total of $200 in the world.\n\nSuddenly, a wild bank appears. I deposit my $100 in the bank. I still have $100 and you still have $100. Now you want to buy something from me that costs $150. You go to the bank to loan money. The bank has $100 available so gives you $50. You give me $150. Now I have $250 and you are $50 in debt. I deposit the $150 in the bank.\n\nWe do this again and again, until I have $1000 on my bank account, and you are $900 in debt. I want to buy a house of $500 and go to my bank, demanding to take out $500. But there is only $200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $200.\n\n\"Money\" has been created out of thin air, but it's actually you who are in debt. If you go bankrupt, the bank has a big debt it won't get back, and is in deep shit when I come around to demand my money back. At that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap, because if the bank fails, I will lose all my pension savings I put into that bank, as well as my companies and a lot of my employees.\n\nAnd other banks loaned this bank money, so if this bank fails, the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail, because then they will also have debts that won't be paid back.\n\nThere are regulations minimizing this - i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts, so there's a maximum limit of \"money created\".\n\n To summarize, the money never existed. The best example I can give is the housing bubble. Houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money. When people couldn't make their payments, the house prices crashed.\n\nThe boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended (boom) and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes (bust).\n\nThe real question that people should be asking is not \"Where did all the money go?\", but \"Why is money issued by private banks?\"\n\nMoney is a social invention to facilitate trade. Should it not be like a public water utility? Counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it. Money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized. All natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters, joules, degrees, etc. Money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest. We essentially pay rent on all money that isssued and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created, once again at interest. This is why economists generally say some inflation is good. Finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality, money is just an IOU that requires no such interest payment for it's issue.\n\nInterest should be made if a loan is issued against savings, but not for the simple issuance of money. There should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment. You can read more about this from reading about Arthur Kitson. In this way, the public controls the value of it's money, not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class.\n\nIf you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt, read the work of Frederick Soddy. It's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least. Wealth is subject to the laws of thermodynamics while debt is an invention of the human will. Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this."

        "question": "Why were American, minimally-skilled, workers able to afford single family homes in the 1960s and 1970s, but now they can barely afford apartments for rent?",
        "answer": "There are lots of misconceptions around this topic.\n\nHome ownership rates in general are higher now than in the 70's.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N\n\nThe cost of a house is also not really the plain cost of a house, it's the financing cost. And in that regard, people spend less of their disposable income on mortgages than they did at any prior point in the last 40 years.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDSP\n\nThat doesn't mean houses haven't become more expensive, but that perception is in large parts fueled by the fact that they have become a *lot* more expensive in the most desirable places, the big cities that offer high salaries and a high standard of living. People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.\n\nAnother thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not gone up so drastically.\n\nhttps://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/houses2.jpg?x91208\n\nTwo trends are worth noting however.\n\nPeople on average go to college more often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or more, this happens later in life.\n\nAlso, inequality pushes ownership rates down for the lower half and up for the upper half.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttps://equitablegrowth.org/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race/\n\nSo, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what and where has changed. Not correct in aggregate. Homeownership rates are [higher than they were in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/tables/time-series/coh-owner/owner-tab.txt). \n\nAlso remember that amenities and size of homes has changed over time. Today\u2019s house is different than 1960\u2019s homes."

I'm fine with setting warnings, and you could argue they have a responsibility to their users to inform them when they're doing risky things, but this is the stock market. That's the game we're playing.\n\nI can't believe Robinhood can keep a straight face when they say \"we're just looking out for our clients\" when they have been happy to let new clients automatically start trading on margin with literally no warning or disclaimer about what that entailed. Happy to let WSB bros blow up margin accounts to -50k and go bankrupt in risky triple-leveraged option plays for the past 3 years, but suddenly when those same WSB bros are making 2.5mil simply buying stock, now suddenly it's too risky and \"we gotta look out for the little guy\". It's a fucking joke and I really hope Robinhood goes bankrupt once the dust settles. They deserve it for breaching the trust of their users and manipulating the market in such a nefarious way."

Stop misquoting the 10 economists who were selectively surveyed out of the millions that exist. It\u2019s seems no one believes in supply and demand anymore. Housing prices are caused by too much (or not enough) government intervention. Inflation is caused by printing money and not a supply chain crunch. Everyone has another issue they think is causing a rise or drop in prices, instead of starting with supply and demand and building from there. Economics isn\u2019t about clocking in GDP levels, or making sure the stocks are up; it\u2019s prime purpose is to help people, and to make them better off. I hear a lot of liberal types say that economists fail to understand that people are\u2026. people. That being said, a majority of my studies revolve around measuring/improving social welfare, and on the theory side, maximizing social welfare. Conversely, conservative types seem to get all of their economic ideologies from Micro 101. The problem with this, is the policies suggested in introductory courses are made under the assumption that the markets are perfectly competitive, which is not typically the case in the real world."

But all of this is completely avoidable.\n\nWould a write up on how to choose a Property Manager be warranted on this sub?  \n\n\nEdit:\n\n[How to Choose a Good Property Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/hgmiqp/how_to_choose_a_good_property_manager/) I am an active investor(and agent) and can agree that there are some major difficulties and you certainly do have to assess and be comfortable with the risk involved.  From your story it sounds like your property manager was a disaster.  That is not surprising at all.  It\u2019s a hard job and most property managers are terrible.  They can make or break your experience.  A secondary problem seems to be the condition of the properties.  Stuff breaks, that is par for the course.  However, when you purchase and go through the inspection process you should have some idea how much you will be spending on repairs.  Current repairs and future capital expenditures should be in your budget.  I buy to renovate and expect low out of pocket expenses in the first few years after renovation.  I prefer to spend the money up front and save some future headaches, plus this helps me drive up the value of my properties.  If you buy a property with a lot of differed maintenance or where many of the major systems are at/near the end of their useful life then you have to be prepared for regular large expenditures until the major systems are more up to date.  In my opinion your agent should have prepared you a little more for that but not all agents know investing.  Sorry to hear it didn\u2019t go as well as you had hoped.  Thanks for sharing your story! I think it is the relationship between Property Manager and investor. Both have different goals and I believe an antagonistic relationship. PM makes money when investor is screwed. I have seen excitement only when there is repairs involved. I also feel a lot of PMs are in the property game. The better tenants with good scores and jobs do not even make it to you and will land with the PMs personal property. Not always the case but I think a possibility. Motto is to stay local if possible. Control is everything. Being able to drive and verify repairs and get multiple quotes is important."

        "question": "Is a stock market crash like the ones in 1929 and 2008 impending?",
        "answer": "On this subreddit we mods don't like predictions about stock-market crashes. They are notoriously tricky, for the reason already given by another commenter.\n\nIt is fairly easy though, to explain why the current situation is so troubling. I'm going to concentrate on that.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Federal Reserve performed very expansionary monetary policy. Other Central Banks across the world did something similar. As it turned out that policy was too expansionary. Inflation was caused by various factors including pandemic-induced supply chain problems and the expansionary monetary policy.\n\nAs a result, inflation has been high for quite a while now. Over on /r/badeconomics Integralds gives [the path of the CPI price-level compared to the Fed's aim](https://i.imgur.com/Pfn9szI.png). The price level is now far higher than the Fed's intended path. Since 2020 inflation has averaged 5.25% rather than the 2% aim. If inflation went to 0% next month and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's intended price-level path.\n\nThis leads us to the current problems. The Fed must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary. It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.\n\nThis affects the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)\n\nWhen thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year. Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that, but conventional economics does not give an answer. If it was possible to know the stock market would crash, it would have already crashed. \n\nIf I have a stock, and I know for certain the market will crash, then I would sell the stock and either buy it again when it's cheaper or do something else with the money. If investors all do this however, the stock will crash because everyone is selling. Therefore it's not possible to know that the stock market will crash unless you know something that the large portion of investors don't. 1929 and 2008 were both financial crises, which doesn\u2019t just mean \u201ca very bad recession\u201d but actually has a specific meaning.\n\n1929 initially started as a market decline on a similar path to todays (though on a much shakier ground because of lack of regulation). When the market did decline, however, the Federal Reserve made all the wrong moves, abandoning credit lines and causing a moderate recession to turn into a bad one. This bad recession caused a domino effect-like bank runs because savings weren\u2019t protected. Combined with some natural issues (like the dust bowl) this turned a bad recession into a depression. \n\nThis would not happen today because every person with a minor in Econ knows this is the exact opposite of how the Fed should behave, and we have policies in place to prevent things like bank runs. \n\n2008 was the result of a fundamentally flawed credit market, one that could have absolutely brought down the entire world and probably be worse than 1929. Luckily, we learned the lessons of 1929 and the Fed acted much more aggressively-chairman Ben Bernanke got the nickname \u201cHelicopter Ben\u201d because he circled over the economy injecting stimulus in it. This walked us back and turned a potentially catastrophic Greater Depression into an extremely strong recession. \n\nOur speculation is worth what you paid for it, but to most economists the fear is more like a late \u201870s/early \u201880s stagflationary environment than 1929 or 2008. Supply chain shocks and high inflation a financial crisis has not yet made.\n\nAs far as timing goes, there\u2019s no point speculating in what things will look like 5 or 6 years from now. 5 years is an eternity in an economic cycle."

        "question": "Why is the financial sector able to maintain such high wages and profits compared to other professional services sectors? Why doesn\u2019t this attract more competition that results in wages and profit margins being forced down?",
        "answer": "For the investing industry, there is actually a fair amount of competition. The average hedge fund [only lasts for five years](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/07/31/1913792/most-hedge-funds-fail/), while [the average mutual fund fares marginally better at 8.6.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/can-mutual-fund-get-better-age/) The comparison of compensation scheme to structural engineers is rather unfair: a construction company is done once the building is complete, while a hedge fund continues to actively manage your money the entire time you keep it with them, so charging a percentage of the total assets every year is much more warranted. However, you're right that the infamous 2 and 20 is exorbitant. The good news is that competition is working! [Fees are declining, with only 30% insisting on the traditional 2 and 20.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/only-a-third-of-hedge-funds-charge-2-and-20-fees-says-expert-1541851200) More generally, thanks to competition from low cost index funds, [money is drastically flowing away from actively managed funds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/outflows-inflows-active-passive-stock-funds-51571439212), and some of their largest clients like the [California pension system](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pensions-calpers-hedgefunds/calpers-dumps-hedge-funds-citing-cost-to-pull-4-billion-stake-idUSKBN0HA2D120140916) have sworn off hedge funds. It took a while, but over time, the sheen of active management and their (usually unfulfilled) promises of outperforming the market has worn off, and they're being competed away by lower cost alternatives.\n\nAs for investment banking, the relevant competitive angle is relationships with the CFOs and CEOs at potential client companies. Large firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley provide enough continuity that new entrants into the investment banking industry can develop those relationships as they rise up the ranks, so that by the time they become managing directors they are already chummy with their decision making counterparts. And indeed, most of a managing director's time is spent not doing market research or detailed quantitative analysis but instead [cultivating their relationships with clients](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-career-path/) so that when a CFO is contemplating a capital raise or M&amp;A transaction, the name they know and trust is yours. The idea that competition is based not around price or competence but rather networking may be gauche, but for better or worse it's how the industry works. And because those relationships are very scarce, the people who have them are able to extract large rents.\n\nAll that said, there *is* competition in the investment banking industry, and even new entrants! Most new entrants are what's called [\"boutique investment banks.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique_investment_bank) Such banks are usually founded by a former managing director at a large who has decided that he can leverage his relationships without the corporate name to help him; for example, [Qatalyst, one of the most prominent investment banks for the tech industry, was founded by Frank Quattrone, who was a former star managing director at Morgan Stanley's tech investment banking group in Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quattrone). However, you'll still see the established names like Goldman or Morgan on any deals that a boutique bank facilitates. That's because investment banking often requires a large balance sheet to help finance transactions. While a top managing director can take his relationships with him when he starts his boutique firm, he can't take the balance sheet as well. So rather than try to accumulate enough capital to run an entire deal in house, most boutiques will instead partner with the larger and older firms, where the boutique is providing most of the strategic direction and advice but the older firm is making their balance sheet available for a smaller cut of the fees.\n\n**TLDR: Hedge funds actually *are* being competed away. For investment banks, the relevant dimension is their relationships with CFOs and CEOs, which cannot be competed away except by new firms founded by industry veterans.** **NOTE: Top-level comments by non-approved users must be manually approved by a mod before they appear.**\n\nThis is part of our policy to maintain a high quality of content and minimize misinformation.

        "question": "Wikipedia has a section arguing that supply and demand isn't real, or no longer applies. Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?",
        "answer": "Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe. It also tends to misrepresent orthodox economics and be weirdly out of touch with modern economics (note how most of the people the article cites are heterodox economists, economists from the 1970's or earlier and no modern, mainstream economist is cited). Anyways, in order:\n\n1. No, economic theory makes very sharp predictions about how we think markets will react to exogenous shocks (prices rise when a hurricane destroys crops is a testable prediction). And yes, we can measure supply and demand curves. I would go through this t[hread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/qflpw6/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory/) for more detail and citations. The labor theory of value has been beaten to death in this thread. No, it's still not correct. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6dc83h/z/di2o1lj), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/8ome9s/what_is_your_opinion_of_this_video_by_cockshott/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/666u5i/why_does_marxism_seem_to_be_so_much_more/dikkcfs/) or just search the subreddit.\n2. No, supply and demand still apply to modern goods (again see the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/qflpw6/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory/) for empirical validation of core microeconomic theory). The administrative prices argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable firms survive) &gt;Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?\n\nNo. But we can expand on that a bit.\n\nSupply and demand is a model. Models are approximations of reality. Whether a model is a good approximation of realty in any specific application depends on how well the particular market you're studying lines up with the assumptions of the model. For example, S&amp;D assumes that (a) everyone knows what they're buying, (b) every firm in the market is selling basically the same good, and (c) there are many buyers and sellers, so that no one customer or firm has outsized influence on the good's price. Some markets satisfy those conditions; others do not.\n\nSupply and demand is a general framework that can be used to study a wide variety of market phenomena. However, if you are studying a specific market at a specific time in a specific place, then you might want to use a more detailed model that better conforms to the application under investigation.\n\nThere is an entire field of economics, *industrial organization,* that studies the behavior of supply in situations where the assumptions of supply and demand are not a good approximation for reality. This includes situations in which there are few competitors (monopoly, oligopoly); situations in which competitors compete on brand (monopolistic competition), situations in which one firm's actions depend on the actions of others (game theory), etc. All of these models allow for a more detailed analysis than simple S&amp;D. \n\nUsually S&amp;D should be the first place you go to solve your problem, but not necessarily the last place. You can use S&amp;D to get coarse answers to most questions, and more detailed models to get richer answers. \n\n-----\n\nRegarding the two criticisms you mentioned:\n\n1. S&amp;D is not a tautology; classical consumer and producer theory produces implications that can be tested against data. However, S&amp;D *is* a very general framework (by design), so it can accommodate a rather wide range of behavior.\n\n2. Under supply and demand, firms set price equal to marginal cost. There is no markup, and no profit. This is an extreme prediction. In most richer industrial organization models, firms set price equal to a markup over marginal cost. The size of the markup is a key object of interest in IO, and usually can be linked to demand parameters or other such primitives. But it's not necessarily \"fixed.\" Furthermore, in many IO models, the size of the markup falls as the number of competitors grows large -- so S&amp;D is the \"limit\" as the number of competitors grows.\n\n  You can even use these richer models to put bounds on how good the S&amp;D approximation is; for example, some models allow claims such as \"for any industry with more than 10 competitors, the S&amp;D-predicted price will be within 10% of the more complicated model's predicted price.\" Such bounds can be helpful, and put S&amp;D in its proper context. I wouldn't say these results \"invalidate\" S&amp;D, they just provide a richer model of the price-setting environment.\n\nSo, again, S&amp;D is usually a good first stab at most problems at a high level, and the answers one obtains can be refined by using more advanced models. There are famous cases where the S&amp;D answer and the more complicated model's answer are totally different (such as the case of price controls), but those are famous in part because they're rare.\n\nThink of models less in terms of, \"is the model right or wrong,\" and more, \"is it more or less useful in this particular situation?\" or, \"is it more or less useful in giving reasonable answers in a broad range of situations?\""

        "question": "What do economists know now that they didn't 50 years ago?",
        "answer": "Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability to expand knowledge of industrial methods.\n\nAnother major growth area has been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged in the last 30 or so years.\n\nFinally, changes to the structure of the global economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s, has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency. Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.). For the most part though, computation may arguably one of the biggest contributors to facilitating modern advancements as far as I'm aware. Economics is *very* different than it was 50 years ago. Microeconomics, for instance, has undergone a drastic shift. Microeconomic theory in the 1970s was very much what you might call \"classical\" microeconomic theory- there was still a large focus on consumer and producer theory that underpins general equilibrium, and decision theory was still an active subfield. \n\nSince then, microeconomics evolved; many of the issues in decision theory were worked on and resolved (or at least resolved enough that economists figured further inquiry would be largely mathematical exercises of little real interest). Further, game theory rose to forefront of microeconomic theory and took over the field and has *almost* gotten to the point of exhausting it's traditional lines of inquiry (e.g. game theorists have moved away from a lot of traditional approaches to mechanism design to focus instead on more exotic approaches that yield \"worse case\" bounds or robust mechanisms; good examples of this would be the work of Bergemann or Brooks). Behavioral and Experimental economics (in many ways deeply related to microeconomic theory) became a field, and some of the results (such as Vernon Smith's stock market experiments with ASU undergrads) were deeply shocking to the field (among other things, this experiment exhibited evidence of bubbles arising even in relatively simple settings). \n\nEconometrics evolved as well. For one, in the most recent two or three decades, there's been an explosion of interest in causality on all levels. This means on a philosophical level, on an estimation level, on an implementation level, and in specific particularized applied problems. This has led to drastic advances in econometric methods, giving the applied researcher a very powerful toolbox as well as something of a guide to best practices in experimental implementation (thanks to the work of people like Duflo and Banerjee in doing so many experiments and learning the good practices the hard way). The combination of this interest in experiments, good guidelines, and strong tools for estimation has allowed us to answer questions we would have found impossible to answer before: what is the impact of UBI? Which aid programs to developing countries are most effective at increasing health outcomes? etc. Of course, as an econometrician, I find the theoretical advances that this has brought more interesting, but most people care less about that. Other things of note in econometrics are the rise and fall of a whole theoretical subfield, that of time series analysis (much like decision theory, there *was* a lot of productive work, but most of the questions have been exhausted). Whole nonparametric methods of estimation have come into style, gone out of style, and come back into style in the last 50 years- a good example would be neural networks, which actually saw pioneering work in the early 90s by an *econometrician* who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his many *other* contributions. \n\nFinally, macroeconomic theory is a very different beast than it was 50 years ago. Stagflation and the Lucas critique led to a drastic underlying shift in macroeconomic theory which pulled the field towards microfounded models beginning in the early 80s. While early microfounded models got a lot of well deserved flak, they eventually became an essential part of modern macroeconomic research, and in recent years, the most advanced of these models have become as good at forecasting as the traditional gold standard, VARs. Moving away from macroeconomic \"methods\" and more to macroeconomic \"facts\", many of the crises you mentioned have been taken in stride by macroeconomists in pursuit of understanding economic dynamics. There are certain macroeconomists who constantly emphasize the tightly related role that oil shocks seem to play in the business cycle (one prominent macroeconometrician in particular who emphasizes this that comes to mind is Jim Hamilton). The 2008 financial crisis spurred a whole host of literature on financial networks, systemic risk, and macroprudential policy; the low interest rate environment that results from the GFC spurred research into macroeconomic policy at the zero lower bound (when interest rates are nominally 0). The \"lost decade\" of Japan led to the now Nobel prize winning research of Ben Bernanke on interest rate targeting and forward guidance, research that would inform his actions during and after the GFC.\n\nAll this is to say that economics is a very large and very active field, and if you were a newly minted PhD student in 1972, there's a huge chance that much of what you learned as being the leading edge of economics would be seen as being so outdated as to not even justify inclusion (or inclusion to a significant degree) in the standard first year PhD sequence."

Burry only manages about $1B, he can get out in a couple weeks. \n\nSecondly, Buffett has never said he believes he can predict the market. What if inflation had been transitory? What if the Fed stopped raising rates?\n\nPersonally I have been preaching we are headed for a huge bear market for over a year, and even now think we aren't even close to the bottom.

There's absolutely a need in many parts of the country to help people hope it can be a fruitful relationship for all parties involved. Ok one last, last thing.\n\nI am not understanding how there is such a failure between the way the GOVERNMENT wants housing to be funded for low income people, and the way LANDLORDS want to do it. \n\nIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a huge gap. The government spending on private investors to supply the housing that they fund in a very particular way. Investors are saying no thank you, we can make more on the open market. We refuse to accept your vouchers with all the strings. Something needs to give here. People can\u2019t live in a voucher, it\u2019s a piece of paper. How do you see this program working better, what are some suggestions? Cause right now it\u2019s a pitiful mess There\u2019s been a few comments that were surprised we can charge $850 per month. So just to lay out the housing situation in my area, it\u2019s bad. There\u2019s a few trailer parks that are charging between 1000 and 1200 per month, for single wide trailers that take an additional 5 to 800 per month in electric to heat and cool. Over the winter three different homes have burnt down because they are poorly maintained, built in the 70s, roughly 900 square-foot. A single-family home starts at 1600 per month to rent. There are a few 2 bed apartments that are in the $1100 per month range, and they were waiting list of over 100 people. They also don\u2019t take vouchers :-/\n\nThe Housing Authority and nonprofits currently spend $85 per night on rooms at a few hotels. So over $2,500 a month for similar housing. They were thrilled to be paying $850 for a year solution.\n\nThe people who are on disability and also receiving a voucher are also thrilled to be spending $50 out of pocket, and have all of their utilities covered. We are paying for the electric, gas, Internet, TV, septic, water, and trash. It keeps their cost-of-living low, So they\u2019re no longer choosing between heating the house medicine and food."

        "question": "Your health is your most valuable investment.",
        "answer": "But is it really the case the eating healthy is more expensive? The cheapest products one can buy are veggies and fruits (of course it depends on the period of the year which ones are cheaper). Usually the food which is expensive is the \"fake healthy\" stuff and the organic food. Organic food is a scam, and if done correctly, it is also unsustainable. Could not agree more. This is something I do not understand when people skip out on. Good quality, enjoyable food and drink, as well as good health are of paramount importance for a good quality of life. You should not go cheap on that. That is the core investment by itself, because without it, what is everything else worth?\n\nImportantly, eating healthy is also not necessarily more expensive. Eating out is expensive, eating super processed foods is expensive. Eating out I can understand for the experience and socializing, but the processed foods are dead to me. Just skip out on the all the processed bullshit and super sugary stuff (sugar is way more screwed up than fat) and get started on a balanced diet. By balanced diet, I mean eat everything. Unless you have a very specific goal and know what you are doing, following a restrictive diet is almost always an expensive mistake.\n\nEat what you love every day, but keep switching it up. Cook using basic ingredients and make something awesome; cooking is the most rewarding hobby. Treat yourself and have a glass of wine or drink every day. You don't have to buy organic, it is an unsustainable scam for the most part anyway. Try to buy local instead. If you're vegetarian or vegan, the processed foods are crazy expensive and not very healthy, so try to avoid them -- have them for convenience only. If you're a meat eater, buying ground meat in bulk and putting it portioned in the freezer is cheap and goes a long way. In any case, eating fresh beats eating processed all day every day.\n\nExercise your body and get into fitness. Don't aim for Arnold, aim to be able to run a couple of km/miles and lift weights on an intermediate level and do it twice a week. You will feel so much healthier and it will also help you clear your mind. A decent pair of running shoes and gym pass for a year will cost you but a couple of shares of VT a year. Good fresh food, no unecessary take outs, cut expenses that don't matter, increase expenses in things that matter, constant DCA in MSCI World, buy more when in a dip. Be constant, stay the course, never stop learning. Best investment is in yourself. Raise the intrinsic value of yourself."

        "answer": "IMO the money here is the ability for the kiosks to upsell compared to humans taking your order. I'm sure they have data showing the average order size is larger through a kiosk than human.\n\nKiosks let you browse the menu better and with photos of all items, they can try to upsell you to make it a meal, upsize, etc 100% of the time, they can push promotions and specials, they encourage browsing more of the menu as there's less of a time crunch to complete your order. All around I think it's a great move for the long run. I love those kiosks. Far better than standing in line waiting for a dude with five kids to make up their minds about what they want and to change their minds twenty times.\n\nIt's also immensely better than getting to the counter only to have to wait for the person behind the counter to wrap up his or her flirting with their co-workers or to fill the register back up with change or some other silly housekeeping activity.\n\nLess human interaction, the better. I feel like Kiosks in fast food are like ATMs were in banking.\n\n\nEveryone thought ATMs were going to kill all bank-telling jobs, but instead those tellers have been somewhat re-purposed.\n\nFrom what I've seen the same thing is happening here"

        "question": "Buying an expensive car",
        "answer": "You will always want the next shiny thing.  As long as you are buying your cars right thats not a bad thing.  \n\nFor example.  Last year I bought a used 2019 M5 completion with 2000 miles on it.  Sticker price was $148k.  I paid $105k.  Sold it after a a year for $95k.  That was $800 month for a very expensive car.  \n\nIn 2017 I bought a new Acura NSX with a $190k sticker for $135 k brand new after dealers were discounting the hell out of then.   I have 14k mile son it and current retail on it is about $125k.  Thats a lot of fun for $10k.\n\nI can afford full price brand new cars but I also know I am going to want to trade in often.  If my cost is $1500 per month or less I\u2019m happy. \n\nBuy whatever you want.  Just get a good deal on it and if you get bored you can justify the loss by looking at how much it cost you to enjoy it. I bought a Lamborghini at the end of last year and it's going to be delivered in June! It is my dream car to own since I was a kid and I told myself I would get it when I was finally fatfired.\n\nInitially, I didn't pull the trigger even when we passed 8 figures NW as I've been living abroad without the need for a car. Covid-19 forced us to come back to the US and it made me think of my limited time on this earth. No regrets on my end.  Would have liked to wait for a perfectly speced preowned performante to show up but the secondary market has been limited so decided to say fuck it and pull the trigger and got all the options I wanted. I've purchased a Huracan LP610-4, Murci\u00e9lago LP640, and am in the market for a Ferrari 458 Spider. I do not regret the decision.\n\nFor me cars have been important most of my life. I was raised around them, and my social circles and community are based around them. I have met some of my closest friends through related events, and numerous networking opportunities given the successful nature of the people high end cars tend to attract. That being said, I would have made the same decisions even without the networking options for the simple fact that these machines bring happiness that I feel is worth their relative-financial impact to me.\n\nThe most important thing is that you go into the situation with eyes wide open. For example, the maintenance between my first and second Lamborghini was an order of magnitude different. But I knew this going into it. So when the Murci\u00e9lago's transmission decided it no longer wanted to live a few months into ownership, the impact to my wallet and mental health was substantially tempered. I also personally don't care about owning a *new* car, so I do a lot of research ahead of time to get into a model/year that is in a healthier portion of its depreciation curve. [Four Wheel Trader](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvuqaQ4IyACFWmR0E-aBouQ) on YouTube can help with that.\n\nRegarding the \"next shiny thing\", the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) is a very real thing. I found that when I daily-drove my Huracan (because it was so easy), it quickly became less special, and my BMW M3 seemed really boring. When I got the Murci\u00e9lago I was forced to pace myself more, and only take it out sometimes. This dramatically improved the \"keeping it special\" feeling. This is all obvious I'm sure seeing it written out, but it's worth repeating."

        "question": "Is the gaming/e-sport area a good investment?",
        "answer": "Esports is overhyped right now and not seeing returns. Don't touch with a tenfoot pole any company that calls itself \"esports\" because even the esports industry is struggling to actually get money out of the market. Also, very little is public; most of the promise is in venture capital.\n\nGaming, however, is pretty solid. The big guys - Tencent, Activision, Microsoft, EA, Nintendo, Sony, Ubisoft etc - all are doing very well on fundamentals and gaming expanded its audience over the pandemic anyway. Activision \\*may\\* have some pushback regarding the recent lawsuit but I also tend to know that many people on the internet will say one thing and do another, and the biggest scandals aren't necessarily pushed out to the broader community.\n\nThe big guys diversify their portfolio enough to absorb any \"failures\" in their gaming offerings. The smaller ones are more susceptible to risk. Depending on what you want to do with the stock, you could just buy the big guys and leave it or trade around on the smaller folks. I haven't researched ESPO, but what I can tell you is that investing in companies that make video games is very risky. Take something like CDPR for example. For years they've been treated like heroes and the saviors of the gaming world and then their whole reputation (and with that, their stock price) came from an all time high, to a massive, still continuing drop just cause of one game.\n\nSomething like Nvidia or AMD would be a relatively safe investment in my opinion. Both companies are doing great and as long as there's demand for consoles, computers, AI, etc. (which there most definitely is), then their stock prices will perform well. My suggestion would be not to do it at the moment, the gaming sector is over valued at the moment (what isnt). I have been investing in it regularly from February and I'm in the red with it (its only 5% of my etfs) and beating myself for not putting it into SP500 or world stocks."

Possibly even worse because the government hasn't really reset the levers it used from last time.

Is it even possible as an investor to understand the business well enough to see these things coming?\n\nIn 2008 loads of them tanked because they'd been lending much too generously, but very few people saw any warning signs.\n\nSo yeah I think for me I personally avoid individual bank stocks (would happily own some as part of a broad etf) because I don't think it's possible to understand what is happening, even if you spend a lot of time researching them."

I also think EV stocks are a pretty big bubble (though I did make 1000% on 4k of TSLA over the years). From my education and 10 years of working in the power sector, I would say you want to look for companies making stationary battery systems (other than TSLS cause bubble) and other distributed energy resources. That's what I'm seeing in the industry in a big way. That's the job that I have, integrating these. For solar picks, $TSLA is also a play. While they are a tech company, they are all about green energy, even bought a solar company. It has been rocky for that side of their business, but it's a play. Plus you get all the upside of Elon tweeting about nonsense, and the cars I guess. I would recommend people to not invest in anything hydrogen related. There hasn't been any significant developments the last decade when it comes to producing hydrogen cost-efficently. \n\nA hydrogen vehicle basically has a hydrogen powerplant inside it which produces electricity powering the car. But the amount of electricity required to produce hydrogen is tremendous compared to the amount of electricity needed to run an EV, so why not just get an EV then?"

Kinda a simple estimate, but it'll get you to a ballpark. Depending on how nerdy you want to me, you may also consider average estimated miles driven and compare to your cars MPG rating (minus maybe 10% because dealers inflate this) to get a #gallons used per month estimate.\n\nSimilar situation with food: tell yourself you'll only buy food for one week, try to eat only that food, then extrapolate that out by multiplying by rougly 4.5 (cuz 30d in a month not 28).\n\nFor utilities, if you're in a new-to-you house, you could call the utility companies and they'll tell you average monthly spend from previous tenants.\n\nKeep in mind, the smaller sample size you use for estimates, the greater the potential variability (i.e. extrapolating from one week doesn't factor in buying salt or dish soap in your grocery budget because you don't buy them every week), but it should get you a rough estimate to help you plan moving forward."

        "answer": "Not an expert.\n\nBut I think your approach is overly ambitious. Maybe it's possible. But very ambitious. What you are trying to do is using fundamental indicators for 3/4 of 1000 companies, and correlate them to their next year gain. Then use that model to try to predict the performance of 1/4 of 1000 companies. It may work if you are clever enough. But why would you expect it to work? They are different companies, in different sectors, with different expected balance sheets, etc. For example, it's expected that REITs pay more dividends than others, you can't use that to predict the next year movements when you train REITs companies to predict non REITs companies. As you notice correctly, the model just overfits your training data.\n\nWell it's validating, not prediction.\n\nHere is a naive way to improve this. Group them by sectors, and do the same on each sector. Maybe it makes a little more sense since you can assume some sort of similarities between the companies in the same group. But not much.\n\nAnother less naive way is look within history of a company. Use historic indicators to train and correlate them to the next period gain. Let's assume you can look at indicators per earnings report, so period is quarterly. You can train 3/4 and validate 1/4 to see if it has any prediction value. Per a company, there may not much to train, but that's something you have to work with. Suppose it has some prediction value for a subset of companies, you can then use your model to choose the best assets to invest depending on the result for each company, say rank them from high return to low return. Of course, you are gonna have a bunch of models to store, thousands of them. And if none of those models have any prediction value, well as I said, I'm not an expert.\n\nI'm interested to know your follow up though if you decide to do any follow up experiment. I'm far from an expert but it is naive to believe that you'd be able to create a model that performs well using only H2O AI especially without understanding anything about how the underlying technology works.\n\nHere's where you could improve:\n\n* You need at *least* 10x more training data, ideally 100x or even 1000x more.\n* Use cross validation instead of throwing away 25% of your training data.\n* Apply normalization functions to your momentum indicators, overlap studies, volatility and volume indicators.  Without this your model will **NEVER** converge.\n* Use an activation function that is better suited to the feature bounds such as tanh.\n* Use either a \"long short-term memory\" network or better yet a \"generative adversarial network\".  Regression is a dead end.\n* Input dropout should always be zero.\n* Hidden layer dropouts are likely far too low.\n* The quantity and size of the hidden layers doesn't make sense.\n* Instead of using a fixed number of epochs you should continue training until the accuracy of the validation set reaches an acceptable threshold.\n* Save your training progress along the way in case your model overfits and you overwrite a better performing model.\n\nEven after addressing all of these things your model will still most likely struggle to predict downturns.  Better indicators than your standard ADX, AROON, MACD, RSI, TRIMA, ATR etc will be required to overcome this hurdle operating on numerous time frames.\n\nBest of luck and happy model hunting."
